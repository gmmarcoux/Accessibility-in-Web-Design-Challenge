# Code Refactor Starter Code - Accessibility in Web Design 

#Description
Features (alternatives) / cleaned up code and added semantic elements 

A marketing agency aspires to have accessible code for their wed design. This code includes semantic elements that better describe the layout of the page with cleaner and more specific code. The CSS has been organized into better groupings that adhere to a cascading effect. Rather than just calling the marketing agency's website, "website," a new name, "Horiseon," has been choosen to describe and indicate their company. As such, images have alternative attributes that consisely describe what is being displayed.
